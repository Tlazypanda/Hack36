WebApp for elderly people to ease their lives.  

An NLP based chatbot that through intents help ease the lives of elderly people and people with disabilities by allowing them to :-  
1.Buy prescription drugs online through blockchain thus ensuring trustless and secure payments.  
2.Facial recognition that allows them to remember their fellow caregivers.  
3.Object dectection that allows them to find objects around them.  
4.News and weather updates on their request.  

The problem Care solves
The elderly people find it difficult to do simple tasks, like reading documents, remembering faces, navigating etc. because of their memory loss and vision-impairment. Data shows that 1.3 billion people have some level vision impairment. But the only solutions available are costly and work on amplifying the image quality, thus helping only a section of those people.
